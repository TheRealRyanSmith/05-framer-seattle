Resources and references for group work from Framer JS Seattle meet up number five.

### Framer Resources

[Framer Website](http://framerjs.com/) – Tons of great resources from the basics, to examples with code, to links to videos and written tutorials.

[Framer Docs](http://framerjs.com/docs/)

[Framer Video Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5gUZ7lKGrAbLOkHv2xfbw) - Great, easy to follow set of videos produced by the Framer team.


### iPhone Apps for Previewing on Device

[Frameless](https://stakes.github.io/Frameless/) – Frameless for iOS 8 is the browser that gets out of your way. It's made for designers and developers who need an easy way to preview prototypes on iOS devices.

[Frames](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/frames-mirror-gallery-for/id1016029345?mt=8) – Frames is an app that lets you add, store and browse through your Framer prototypes.


### EBook

[CoffeeScript for FramerJS](http://coffeescript-for-framerjs.com/) – Independent ebook. I think it's pretty easy to follow – even without much experience in CoffeeScript – and has five UI prototyping examples that progressively get more complex.


### Project Files in This Repo

example.framer shows a super-simple example of layers, states, and events.

instaproto.framer and instaproto.sketch is an example of importing a Sketch file and creating a simple state-based animation.
