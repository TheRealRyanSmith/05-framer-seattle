Resources and references for group work from Framer JS Seattle meet up number five.

[Framer Website](http://framerjs.com/) – Tons of great resources from the basics, to examples with code, to links to videos and written tutorials.

[Framer Docs](http://framerjs.com/docs/)

[CoffeeScript for FramerJS](http://coffeescript-for-framerjs.com/) – Independent ebook. I think it's pretty easy to follow – even without much experience in CoffeeScript – and has five UI prototyping examples that progressively get more complex.
